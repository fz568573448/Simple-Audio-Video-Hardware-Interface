This is an FPGA-based implementation of VGA and 3.5mm hardware interface with an interesting application, written in VHDL.

# Features

* VGA and 3.5mm hardware interface with the help of AK4520 and AD7125 DAC chip
* 8-bit style music decoder
* Show a picture and the music real-time level on the screen

# Environment

I synthesized and ran the program on a microcomputer interface technology experiment development board called EDK-SP6ADSP-TXMFI001, which equipped with a Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA chip and an XC6S45LXT motherboard chip.

It's almost impossible for you to run this program, and so am I, because I don't have the development board now, just like you. :)

# Details and Demo

You can get more details by browsing [my blog](https://fanzheng.org/archives/38) (in Chinese) and there is a demo video at the bottom of the post.
